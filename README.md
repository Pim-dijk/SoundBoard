# SoundBoard
My practice application with WPF and MVVM where I create a soundboard.

Features:
- Add files/folder via Windows Dialog
- Drag and drop files to add to the SoundBoard
  - In either the directory or on the application itself
- Add audio from a url, either audio only or video (downloads video to seperate folder)
- Set custom image for each sound (get's video thumbnail)
- Add/Change Name, Category, Image, keybinds and Volume for each sound
- Select audio output device
- Global keyboard hook

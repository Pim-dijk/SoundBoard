# SoundBoard
Practice with WPF and MVVM where I create a soundboard application.

Features:
- Add files/folder via Windows Dialog
- Drag and drop files to add to the SoundBoard
  - In either the directory or on the application itself
- Add audio from a url, whether audio only or video
- Set custom image for each sound
